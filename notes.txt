Edited the python script because it wasn't working using #!/usr/bin/python.  make ! a space to comment out.

Registers:
1: Net value
2: Peak demand in Watts
3: The third ERT, ERT number 56464688 sends back the kWh Delivered.  
   With this value you can determine how much energy is returned to the grid (kWh Received),
     it is simply kWh Received = kWh Delivered - kWh Net.

Is this right?
Consumed = Produced + Net

Keeping for future exploration:
                # cmd = "/usr/bin/node ~/envoy/pvout.js --verbose --meter %i --timestamp %s > ~/envoy/pvout.log" % (last_meter - meter, timestamp)


Logging cmd when using Sparkfun adaptor:
cd ~/envoy
clear && python amrlogger.py --port=/dev/ttyUSB0 -r -l -v
   Or for POV-1
clear && python amrlogger.py --port=/dev/ttyAMA0 -r -l -v


Booting:
/boot/cmdline.txt WAS:
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles

IS:
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles


Also did:
sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service

  Actions taken:
  edited /boot/config.txt
    added:
  dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,pcf2127

  edit /lib/udev/hwclock-set
    commented out the if with [ -e /run/systemd/system ] ...

    commented out the two lines containing --systz

RTC Commands:
  # Writes system time to hwclock:
  sudo hwclock -w

  # Read rtc:
  sudo hwclock -r

  # copy time from rtc to system:
  sudo hwclock -s
